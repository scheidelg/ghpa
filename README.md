# GitHub Pages Authentication (GHP-Authentication or GHPA)

GitHub Pages is a simple way to create and a website to publish content from a public or private GitHub repository. However, GitHub Pages doesn't provide any authentication controls. This means that once GitHub Pages is enabled for a private GitHub repository, all repository content is publicly accessible via the website.

However, we can implement secure web access to a private repository files by creating two separate repositories:

 1. A private repository.

     - Contains content that we want to publish on a website, but not to the public.

     - GitHub Pages is **not** enabled on the private repository.

     - Access is managed using GitHub's built-in authentication controls.

  2. A public repository.

      - Contains front-end content that is accessible by the public.

      - GitHub Pages **is** enabled on the public repository.

      - Client-side JavaScript leverages GitHub's API to access the private repository, using authentication credentials submitted by the user.
      
> Note: Technically this doesn't need to be a public repository; it can be a private repository with GitHub Pages enbled. For clarity in these notes, I'll continue to refer to this as the 'public' repository.

Whenever a webpage is accessed on the GitHub Pages website, GHPA can automatically attempt to load and render a corresponding page from the private repository. The first time the private repository is accessed the user can be presented with a form to provide authentication credentials; if desired, subsequent attempts to retrieve content from the private repository (or private repositories) can reuse those credentials to achive a single sign-on (SSO) effect.

This is certainly not as robust or full-featured as a web-application firewall (WAF) but it suits my needs:

 - Quick stand-up leveraging GitHub and GitHub Pages.
 
   All that's required is to stand-up the two GitHub repositories, include the GHPA.js on the GitHub Pages website, and create the files on the private GitHub repository.

 - Secure-enough for my needs (see the [GitHub Credential Security with GHPA](GitHub-Credential-Security.md) document).

 - Low-cost (free aside from the time invested in creating GHPA).

 - It gave me an excuse to practice JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Step-by-step instructions are in the [GHPA Step-by-Step Instructions](GHPA-Step-by-Step.md) document.

There *are* **absolutely** security considerations that you should keep in mind. See the [GitHub Credential Security with GHPA](GitHub-Credential-Security.md) document.

## Configuration and Features

Configuration of GHPA is controlled by setting JavaScript global variables. Currently this is done by editing the master GHPA.js script; I'm going to switch this over to a JSON configuration file.  Global configuration options include:

 - Identifying the default GitHub organization, repository, and branch that will be accessed for private content.
 
 - Identifying the default file name (e.g., 'index.html') that will be retrieved from the private repository if a user browses to an empty directory on the GitHub Pages site.

 - Identifying a standard login form that can be modified once and rendered on multiple pages on the GitHub Pages site.

 - Enabling or disabling single sign-on (SSO) (see the [GitHub Credential Security with GHPA](GitHub-Credential-Security.md) document).

Configuration options that can be set for individual GitHub Pages webpages include:

 - The default GitHub organization, repository, and branch can be overridden.

   This means that a single GHPA-enabled website can render content from multiple private repositories.

 - A specific private repository file can be loaded (instead of one that matches the name of the GitHub Pages webpage).

See [GHPA Configuration Options](GHPA-Configuration.md) for details.

Also of note:

 - Any general website content - for example, an initial index.html, style sheets, standard header and footers, error pages - can be on the GitHub Pages website and don't need to be mirrored in any way on the private repository.

 - A custom 404 page can be created on the GitHub Pages website and used to load and render files from the private repository.

   This means that you don't have to create a 'stub file' on the GitHub Pages website for every file in the private repository; just create the custom 404 page.
