GitHub Pages Authentication (GHP-Auth or GHPA)

For details on GHPA see:

 - GHPA GitHub repository: https://github.com/scheidelg/ghpa
 
 - Corresponding GHPA website, published through GitHub Pages:
   https://scheidelg.github.io/ghpa or https://ghpa.scheidel.net
   
 - GHPA GitHub repository - README.md:
   https://github.com/scheidelg/ghpa/blob/master/README.md>README.md

The GHPA JavaScript and example HTML contain a large amount of comments,
which you may want to strip out before using on a website.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


/*============================================================================
Declare and define the public variables that configure the GHPA environment,
including the private GitHub organization, repository, and branch from which
we want to retrieve content.

Switch this over to a JSON configuration file later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Global variables are named starting with 'ghpa'.  Local variables aren't.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ghpaAuthOnlyFlag              boolean

    Flag whether a web page that calls ghpaRetrieve() should just perform an
    authentication check (e.g., authentication-only) or should load a page
    from the private GitHub repository.  This is set globally in this file
    but can be overridden within an individual web page, for example:

        <head><script>ghpAuthOnlyFlag=true;</script></head>

    True:  authentication-only
    False: load a page from the private GitHub repository (recommended global
           value)

ghpaBranch                    const string

    Name of the repository branch to use when accessing the private GitHub
    repository.

ghpaDefaultHTMLfile           const string

    Name of the file to load if  ghpaRetrieve() is called with ghpaFileName
    set to a directory name or from a web page that has a
    window.location.pathname of a directory name.  In both cases, identified
    by the name ending in a '/a' character.

    Typically set to 'index.html'.

ghpaOrg                       const string

    Name of the organization to use when accessing the private GitHub
    repository.

ghpaRepo                      const string

    Name of the repository to use when accessing the private GitHub
    repository.

ghpaSSOFlag                   boolean

    Flag whether a web page that calls ghpaRetrieve() should just use and save
    credentials to be used for single sign-on (SSO).  When SSO is used:

     - after successful authentication to the private GitHub repository, an
       authentication token is saved in memory

     - when attempting to access the private GitHub repository, memory is
       checked for a saved authentication token; if found, the token is used
       instead of prompting the user for authentication credentials

    This is set globally in this file but can be overridden within an
    individual web page, for example:

        <head><script>ghpSSOFlag=false;</script></head>

    True:  SSO is in use (recommended global value)
    False: SSO is not in use

ghpaFilename                  string

    The filename to retrieve from the private GitHub repository.  This can
    optionally be set in the calling web page to specify that a specific
    file should be retrieved instead of just using the
    window.location.pathname of the current browser window.  For example:

        <head><script>ghpaFilename='getthisfile.html';</script></head>

    This is generally *not* set.

/*============================================================================
function ghpaLoadPage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attempt to retrieve authentication credentials from memory and - if SSO is
enabled - use them to retrieve content from the private GitHub repository.

If:

 - SSO is enabled,
  - authentication credentials can be retrieved from memory, and
  - the private GitHub repository file can be retrieved

then the page content is replaced with the retrieved content.

Otherwise, the login form is loaded and (if there was a failed attempt to load
content) a status message displayed.
   
This function needs to be called within the <body> of the calling web page;
otherwise it will generate an error when it tries to modify elements within
the <body> that haven't yet been loaded.  The recommended method is to use
the 'onload' method.  For example:

    <body onload='ghpaLoadPage()'>

Another option is to run the script within - preferably at the bottom of - the
<body>.  For example:

    <body>
        HTML goes here.
        
        <!-- ideally this should be at the bottom of the <body> -->
        <script>ghpaLoadPage();</script>

function ghpaRetrieve(form)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attempt to authenticate to and retrieve content from the private GitHub
repository.

If authentication is successful and ghpaSSOFlag is true, then save credentials
in memory for later use.

If content can be retrieved and ghpaAuthOnlyFlag is false, then update the
content on the calling web page.

If there are any errors, update HTML on the calling web page to display the
error message.

This function can be called either from ghpaLoadPage() or directly from a web
page.  For the latter case, the most common use would be to call as part of
the submit action on a form.  For example:

    <form onsubmit="event.preventDefault(); ghpaRetrieve(this);">

Arguments

form                          form element

    The form element must have two input fields:

     - An id of 'ghpaLogin' to hold the user's login name.

     - An  id of 'ghpaPassword' to hold the user's password.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Return Value

true:  received an HTML response code of 200 when retrieving the content
       from the private GitHub repository

false: did *not* receive an HTML response code of 200
